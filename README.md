# Code Sample For 1point3acres

This is the code for web development course project. People can use this website to guess results for sport events, get scores, and compare with others.

I use this as the sample code because this project includes front-end, back-end, communicating with database and so on.

Following is my original README

# GuessMasters

This is a final project of Web development course.

To start the whole program, you need to type in the command line:
